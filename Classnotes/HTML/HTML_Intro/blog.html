    <p> Summer grilled vegetables are a vibrant and flavorful medley of fresh produce, 
        including bell peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, cherry tomatoes, 
        red onions, asparagus, and mushrooms. Marinated in olive oil, balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, garlic,
         and fresh herbs, these vegetables are grilled to perfection, enhancing their natural sweetness and adding a smoky char.
          This colorful dish is a healthy, delicious addition to any summer meal, whether served as a side, a salad topping, or a 
          vegetarian main course.</p>

    <h1>Hiking</h1>

     <p> This 4.8km (3-mile) loop takes in just about everything
         that makes Newfoundland special. 
        Think historic root cellars constructed by early settlers, 
        a natural sea arch, rocky cliffs, scenic stretches of coast,
         green forests and the remains of a community since abandoned. 
        The empty houses youâ€™ll wander by on
         parts of this trail give an icy, 
        fingers-on-the-neck vibe.</p>
